# Timetables using Prolog and LISP

## System for Organizing Shifts with Restrictions
This project aims to develop an intelligent system, using Prolog and Common LISP, to organize shift schedules respecting different types of restrictions related to availability, preferences and compatibilities between the people involved.

## ‚ú® Goals
Create a flexible and configurable system that distributes people into shifts in an optimized way, considering constraints such as:
- Availability of working hours. Ex: Person X can only work from 10 am or only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- Participant preferences. Ex: Person Y prefers to work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but is willing to work on Tuesdays if necessary.
- Joining and separating people. Ex: Person X prefers to work with person Y, while person Z cannot work on the same day as person Y.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- Language: Prolog (SWI-Prolog) and Common LISP

## üöÄ How to Execute
### Prolog
1. Install SWI-Prolog.
2. Clone this repo:
```git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/timetables-prolog.git```
```cd timetables-prolog```
3. Execute the main file:
```swipl [timetables].```
### LISP
1. Use a Common LISP implementation (example: LISPWORKS)
2. Load and execute the main in your environment
